# DAOPatternDesignSRM
This is the first time I used a Design pattern to make CRUD possible in both Memory (using List) and Database using JDBC and mySQL.

Since I'm not yet used to working in UI, I have used basic println function to interact with the user and fetch data. The data returned is also showed in the terminal as well.

The main learning from this project was to create various layers that will make designing easier.

New branches to this will introduce various better ways to code in this pattern. Right now, the code is repititive.
